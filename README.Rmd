## Overview

This package is a start on a collection of utility functions for connecting to databases on
PostgreSQL servers. I created this package primarily for my own use. 

The idea of storing credentials in the .Renviron file originated from a post by Hadley Wickham:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html

## Installation

There was a bug in R-3.4.0 that prevented installation of this package. You will need to install
R-3.4.1 or higher

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arestrom/repg")
```
