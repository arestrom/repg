Title: Tools for working with PostgreSQL Databases
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Are Strom
Maintainer: Are Strom <are.strom@gmail.com>
Description: A collection of tools to work with PostgreSQL connections and
    databases. Connection functions require credentials to be stored in your
    .Renviron file. This avoids the need to supply usernames or password in 
    code. It also avoids potential for accidentally exposing credentials when
    sharing code in public repositories.
